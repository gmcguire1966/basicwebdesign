            <h1 class="heading_style">The Lightsaber</h1>
            <p>The lightsaber is perhaps the most iconic weapon in the Star Wars universe. 
                A blade made of pure plasma contained within a magnetic field, it is both a symbol of the Jedi and a tool of the Sith. 
                The lightsaber represents the connection between a Force user and their skill, discipline, and philosophy. 
                Whether wielded in combat or used for ceremonial purposes, the lightsaber holds a special place in the hearts of Star Wars fans.</p>

                    It is typically made of metal and houses the internal components, including the power cell and Kyber crystal.</li>
                <li>Blade: The blade of a lightsaber is made from plasma, and it can vary in color depending on the Kyber crystal used to power it. 
                    Most commonly, Jedi wield blue or green blades, while Sith typically use red blades, a result of synthetic crystals or corrupted Kyber crystals.</li>
