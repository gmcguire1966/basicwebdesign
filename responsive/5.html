         <img class="movie_post" src="images/The_Mandalorian_season_3_poster.jpg" alt="Mandalorian">
         <p>The Mandalorian is a live-action Star Wars series that follows Din Djarin, a lone bounty hunter in the outer reaches of the galaxy, 
            far from the authority of the New Republic. 
            Set after the fall of the Empire but before the rise of the First Order, the series begins with Din taking on a mysterious bounty:
             a child known as Grogu (often called "Baby Yoda"). Instead of turning Grogu over, Din chooses to protect him, 
             leading to a series of adventures across the galaxy as they evade Imperial remnants and form unexpected alliances. 
             The show explores themes of honor, identity, and the meaning of family.</p>

            Ahsoka's efforts to stop Grand Admiral Thrawn’s return and find her missing friend, Ezra Bridger. Blending action, mystery, and legacy,

                fighter. It delves into the rise of the Rebel Alliance, the brutality of the Empire, 
                and the sacrifices made for freedom, offering a grounded, mature take on the Star Wars universe.</p>
